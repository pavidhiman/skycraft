Skycraft uses drones to capture video footage of infrastructure and surrounding areas after a natural disaster. The video data is converted into a 3D render, via Gaussian Splatting. The 3D model identifies cracks in buildings and other dangers. An attached temperature sensor on the drone can identify leaks through temperature change and potential bodies in buildings. 

This will all be converted into a dashboard with a temperature/humidity graph, AI chatbot to summarize given video data and an iFrame to navigate the 3D render, each allowing first responders to move more effectively within their crucial 72h after a disaster.
